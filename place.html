        <h2>About Nigeria</h2>
        <p>
          Nigeria, often called the "Giant of Africa," is a vibrant and diverse
          country located in West Africa. It is home to over 200 million people
          and boasts more than 250 ethnic groups, with rich cultural traditions,
          music, and languages. Nigeria is known for its dynamic cities like
          Lagos and Abuja, beautiful landscapes such as the Zuma Rock and Obudu
          Cattle Ranch, and natural wonders like the Niger River and Aso Rock.
          Nigerian cuisine is bold and flavorful, featuring dishes like jollof
          rice, pounded yam, egusi soup, and suya. The country is also a
          powerhouse of creativity, especially in literature, fashion, and its
          globally recognized film industry, Nollywood.
